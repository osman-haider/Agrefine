# Agrefine: ML-based Agriculture Android Application

Agrefine is an Android application designed to assist farmers and agriculture enthusiasts in optimizing their crop cultivation and trading processes. The application is divided into three primary functionalities:

1. **Crop Prediction**: Agrefine uses machine learning models to predict suitable crops based on the user's soil specifications. This prediction helps users make informed decisions about what crops to cultivate in their agricultural land.

2. **Fertilizer Suggestion**: Similar to the crop prediction feature, Agrefine provides fertilizer recommendations tailored to the predicted crop. This ensures that users apply the right fertilizers for optimal crop growth and yield.

3. **Agricultural Product Marketplace**: Agrefine offers a platform for users to buy and sell agricultural products. It utilizes Firebase as the backend database to facilitate product listings, transactions, and communication between buyers and sellers.
